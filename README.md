# Grocery-Store-Management-System
This project is designed for grocery store vendors to keep track of their data. The user-friendly programme allows the vendor to store name of an item, its price
and its quantity in a file. The vendor can also delete a record, edit price and quantity of an item and can also view the file through some simple commands.
The project uses python language. Common topics like conditionals and loops are used and 2 modules are imported to make things easier.
